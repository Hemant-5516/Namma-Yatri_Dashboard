# Namma-Yatri Dashboard
## Project Objective
The Namma Yatri ride-booking platform aims to optimize ride allocation, understand customer behavior, and improve driver performance. The goal of this dashboard is to analyze the platform's ride data to gain insights into peak booking times, top-performing drivers, fare trends, and areas with high demand, which will help improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
